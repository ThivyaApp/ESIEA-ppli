# ESIEA-ppli
>IONIC mobile application by [APPUDURAI Thivya](https://github.com/ThivyaApp)

## Introduction 
ESIEA'ppli is a hybrid mobile application that helps students to have all the information about the different associations of my school (ESIEA).

The application is directly connected to the social network pages of each association as it is the only way to get access of these data. 

Moreover, students will have access to all the different plateforms of the school in one place. 
For example, we have a website for the timetable and another one to see our results during the year. But thanks to ESIEA'ppli, we have all the links in one page.

## Used technologies 
Application Development and Structure (Framework) : [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/)
Interface Designs: HTML5, CSS3
Backend : Javascript, Node.js

The data of each association is from the facebook [Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api?locale=fr_FR) API.

### Other plateformes 
As you can see, we have access to different platforms of the school. These are links to the original website as there is no API for these website.
